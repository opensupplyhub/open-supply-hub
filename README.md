## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net)
  - `brew install shellcheck`

## Setup
- Clone repo
```
git clone git@github.com:opensupplyhub/open-supply-hub.git
cd open-supply-hub
```
- You will need to create an .env file from the provided .env.sample file.
```
cp .env.sample .env
```
- Edit that file and add the google maps API key to GOOGLE_SERVER_SIDE_API_KEY=
Reach team member for actual values.

### Google Maps Platform

OS Hub requires a Google Maps Platform API key to interface with the Maps JavaScript API, Maps Static API, and Maps Geocoding API.

Without an API key, facility detail maps will not load on the client and geocoding will not function on the server. The basemap will also be low-resolution and watermarked with "for development purposes only."

See [Getting Started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#procedures) and [Get the API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-the-api-key) for an overview on how to get setup.

```diff
-GOOGLE_SERVER_SIDE_API_KEY=
-REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SIDE_API_KEY=
+GOOGLE_SERVER_SIDE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
+REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SIDE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
 REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY=
 ```

 _Note: Google Maps Platfom requires creation of a billing account, but [they offer](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/) $200 of free monthly usage, which is enough to support development._


### Kick-off & start local development
- Install node and create database structure
```
./scripts/update
```
- Polulate database with seeded facility lists
```
./scripts/reset_database
```
- Start Docker containers in the background (needed to process facilities via Kafka)
```
docker compose up -d
```
- Launch deduplication process of seeded lists to create new facilities (please note that all containers and services must be up, see step before)
```
./scripts/manage matchfixtures
```
- Now you are ready for quick start the app
```
open http://localhost:6543
```

### Restore the DB dump in the local Docker DB container

1. The project containers must be running locally.
2. Download prod dump file
3. Place it in `./dumps/` folder
4. Then run in the terminal of your machine
```
docker compose exec -T database pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d openapparelregistry -U openapparelregistry < ./dumps/[dump_name].dump
```

### Creation of Superusers

For local development we could create a superuser by Django Shell:
- Then, inside the container, execute
```
./scripts/manage createsuperuser
```
And add username (email) and a password.

In staging and production we do not have access to the Django Shell so granting
superuser permissions to a member of the OS Hub team or development team that needs
to manage the system requires the use SQL statements to adjust the permissions.

- Connect to the staging or production database via the bastion instance
- Run the following command

```sql
UPDATE api_user
SET is_staff = true, is_superuser = true
WHERE email ilike '{the user's email address}';
```

- You should see `UPDATE 1` printed to the console. If not, check the email
  address and verify that the user has in fact registered an account in the
  environment (staging or production).

### Upload a list and process it

With no AWS batch service being available unless configured, list processing must be triggered manually.
This requires a list to be uploaded, in this example, the list number was 16. You can get the list number by navigating, via the dashboard (http://localhost/dashboard), selecting ‚ÄúView Contributor Lists‚Äù, then choosing the one you uploaded, then checking the address bar field (possibly clicking on it to reveal the details), which should read http://localhost/lists/16 for a fresh installation.
```
./scripts/manage batch_process -a parse -l 16
```
Then the list needs to be approved (in the web browser).
Continue by accepting the list in the web browser dashboard. Then, in the django container command line, execute geocoding and matching.
```
./scripts/manage batch_process -a geocode -l 16
./scripts/manage batch_process -a match -l 16
```


### Hot Reloading üî•

The frontend uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/). When running `server`, the page will automatically [reload](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/#whats-included) if you make changes to the code.

The [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) app runs inside a [Gunicorn](https://www.gunicorn.org) worker. The worker will [restart](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#reload) if you make changes to the code.

### Debugging Django

Breakpoint debugging of the Python back-end is available via Visual Studio Code. To get started, run the Django development server and other services as well by passing the `--debug` flag to the `server` script. Note that you have to run the command below directly and not inside Docker container.

```
./scripts/server --debug
```

In Visual Studio Code, add this config to the `.vscode/launch.json` file:

```json
  "configurations": [
    {
        "name": "Debug Django",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "attach",
        "connect": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 3000
        },
        "pathMappings": [
            {
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src/django",
                "remoteRoot": "/usr/local/src"
            }
        ]
    }
    // Other custom configurations
  ]
```

Select the "Run and Debug" view from the sidebar. At the top of the "Run and Debug" pane, click the green arrow next to the "Debug Django" menu item.

<img width="288" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1042475/153924321-3c60a9de-b528-4dad-92b3-8eb8184987fc.png">

If Visual Studio Code can connect, you should see a play/pause/next menu bar in the top right of the window.

Set a breakpoint by clicking in the column next to the line numbers for a `.py` file. A red dot should appear. Now, if the breakpoint is hit when you visit a page of the app in the browser (note that you can access the site via the Django development server port (8081 by default) or React development server port (6543 by default)), Visual Studio Code should highlight the line in the file, the "Run and Debug" window should be populated with information about currently set variables, and execution of the code should be paused.

### Embedded Maps

Three users in development have embedded map access by default. User c2@example.com has Embed Deluxe / Custom Embed permissions, the highest level; user c3@example.com has Embed+ permissions; and user c4@example.com has general Embed permissions, the lowest level.

In order to access the embedded map for a user with permissions, you must go to their Settings
page and set up the basic map configuration, including height and width. A preview will then
be available on their page, or you can visit http://localhost:6543/?embed=1&contributors=id where 'id' is the contributor's id.
