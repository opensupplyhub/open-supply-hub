            Hello,
        </p>
        <p>
            You are receiving this email because your <a href="https://info.opensupplyhub.org/resources/claim-a-facility">request to claim</a> the following production location on
            Open Supply Hub (OS Hub) has been revoked:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Name of Production Location: {{ production_location_name }}
            </li>
            <li>
                Address of Production Location: {{ production_location_address }}, {{ production_location_country }}
            </li>
            <li>
                OS Hub Profile: <a href="{{ production_location_url }}">{{ production_location_url }}</a>
            </li>

        </ul>
        {% if revocation_reason|length %}
        <p>
            Reason it was revoked:
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ revocation_reason }}
        </p>
        {% endif %}
        <p>
            If you believe your claim should not have been revoked, you can resubmit your request to claim
            with correct and updated information. To do so, go to the profile you would like to claim, click the
            "I want to claim this production location" link at the top of the screen, and follow the next steps.
            Remember to provide supporting evidence to address the reason that your claim was revoked.
        </p>

            Best Regards,
