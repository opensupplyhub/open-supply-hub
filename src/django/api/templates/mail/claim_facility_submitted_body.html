        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>
            You are receiving this email because you submitted a request to
            claim the following production location on Open Supply Hub (OS Hub):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name of Production Location: {{ facility_name }}</li>
            <li>Address of Production Location: {{ facility_address }}</li>
            <li>OS Hub Profile: {{ facility_url }}</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Please note:</b> Buyers can refer their suppliers to claim their
            profiles on OS Hub; however, the claim request will only be approved
            when it is submitted by an owner or senior management associated
            with the production location in question. Requests submitted by a
            buyer will not be approved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The OS Hub Team will review your request and be in touch soon. The
            expected processing time for the initial review of a claim is 10-14
            days.
        </p>
        <p>Best Regards,</p>
