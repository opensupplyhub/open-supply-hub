Hello,

Thank you for submitting your production location information to Open Supply Hub (https://info.opensupplyhub.org/) (OS Hub)!

You can now:
1. Save your OS ID and the public link to your production location profile and share it
with clients and stakeholders:
    - OS ID: {{ os_id }}
    - Public link: {{ location_url }}
2. Claim your production location to take control of
your data and make it visible to more global partners. Itâ€™s free and only takes a few
steps! Claim my production location now ({{ pl_claim_url }}).
3. Learn more about the OS ID and how to use it to advance your business in this Guide for Facilities (https://info.opensupplyhub.org/facilities).

We will now review the documents you submitted to claim the location (https://info.opensupplyhub.org/resources/claim-a-facility)
and either approve or deny the claim. Review of claims typically takes 7 - 10 business days.
You will receive another email when this stage is complete.

Thank you for sharing your information! Your data helps open doors to safe and sustainable
supply chains.

Best Regards,
