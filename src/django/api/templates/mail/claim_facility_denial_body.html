            Hi,
        </p>
        <p>
            You're receiving this email because we denied your request to claim this
            Open Supply Hub facility:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Facility: {{ facility_name }}, {{ facility_address }}, {{ facility_country }}
            </li>
            <li>
                Facility URL: <a href="{{ facility_url }}">{{ facility_url }}</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        {% if denial_reason|length %}
        <p>
            Here's the reason for the denial:
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ denial_reason }}
        </p>
        {% endif %}
        <p>
            The claim information is inaccurate. If you believe this denial to be inaccurate,
            you can reach out to the OS Hub team to provide additional, clarifying information at:
            <a href="mailto:claims@opensupplyhub.org">claims@opensupplyhub.org</a> The team will review
            your claim and get back to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Best wishes,
        </p>
