| Comments: | This is only used to run code quality checks for each change made in a GitHub pull request during development. | Itâ€™s intended for developers to quickly test changes after a merge on a stable and predictable database, among other things. | Continuous QA and feature verification on an environment that closely resembles production in terms of data volume and other characteristics. | An environment used for regression testing and release preparation. It replicates the production setup in terms of resources and data, offering a realistic context to validate stability, performance, and functionality prior to release. |
