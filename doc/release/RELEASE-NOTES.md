## Release 1.9.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: February 24, 2024

### Database changes
#### Migrations:
* 0135_disable_duplicates_and_lowercase_all_emails.py - implementing all emails to lowercase and disables duplicates
* 0136_remove_indexing_unnecessary_emails.py - This migration replaces the old `index_activity_reports_info` and `index_approved_claim` functions with similar ones that do not index emails.
* 0137_add_renewal_period_field.py - add new field to api_apilimit table & rename existing one.
Updated existing users api_apilimit records renewal_period value.

#### Scheme changes
* [OSDEV-835](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-835) - Since the FacilityIndex model is primarily used to store cached facility data and display it publicly via the `/facilities/{id}` API endpoint, only public data can be shown. Therefore, caching emails to the FacilityIndex model was removed from the PostgreSQL indexing functions. All instances where emails are publicly displayed have been removed. The only remaining field is `ppe_contact_email`, but all functionality and code related to PPE will be deleted in this [OSDEV-562](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-562) ticket.

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-562](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-562) - Remove code related to PPE field from `/src/app`

### Architecture/Environment changes
* [OSDEV-829](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-673) Makes `minimum-ratio: 1` It allows to push code with less than 1% diff from main.

### Bugfix
* [OSDEV-848](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-848) When a user tries to create an account with an email that exists in the DB but with a different case of letters, the system returns "An error prevented signing up". Has been fixed to "A user with that email already exists."
* [OSDEV-673](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-673) When a user calls the endpoint `facility/id/history`, instead of a response, receives the error "TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not list", in particular, this happened with the PK20190913BBJ2Y facility. A list with one element (a dictionary) was passed to the function, so an error occurred when trying to index the list with a string. Fixed.

### What's new
* Make login non-case sensitive. [OSDEV-628](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-628). When the user creates an account email saving in lowercase. User  could login with any variations of casing as long as the characters are the same.
* API. Enable token generation based on API permissions in Django. [OSDEV-729](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-729). Updated Settings page to show/hide token tab by user groups. Forbid access to generate token for API if user didn't have permission groups.
* [OSDEV-219](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-219). Data moderator can merge potential match facilities from Confirm / Reject screen.
* [OSDEV-835](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-835) - Remove the display of emails in the `activity_reports` section of the `facilities/{id}` API endpoint, as email information is private.
* [OSDEV-562](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-562) - Remove code related to PPE field from `/src/app`
* API. Add a flag on API Limit page to indicate if package renews monthly or yearly. [OSDEV-781](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-781) Updated logic to support montly & yearly limitation count reset for API calls.

### Release instructions:
* Update code.
* Apply DB migrations up to the latest one.
* Run the index_facilities_new management command.


## Release 1.8.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: January 27, 2024

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-690](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-690) - Correct all existing lint errors to ensure that code quality checks pass successfully via GitHub Actions and can detect new linting errors but not the old ones.
* [OSDEV-719](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-719) Introduce FacilityDownloadSerializerEmbedMode FacilityDownloadSerializer, replace FacilityIndexDownloadSerializer with combination of FacilityDownloadSerializerEmbedMode and FacilityDownloadSerializer
* [OSDEV-732](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-732) Fix issue with circular dependencies between `util.js` and `constants.jsx` modules in React app

### Architecture/Environment changes
* [OSDEV-690](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-690) - Configure running the code quality workflow as part of the continuous integration (CI) for each commit to a pull request. Both frontend (FE) and backend (BE) tests are executed, along with their respective linters. Additionally, `shellcheck` is applied to scripts within the scripts folder.
* [OSDEV-691](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-691) - Implement parallel job running for BE, FE, and bash script code quality checks. Three new scripts were created and can be used to run the same checks during local development to verify BE, FE, and bash scripts in the ./scripts folder.
* [OSDEV-692](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-691) - Implement code coverage checks for the React and Django apps using `barecheck/code-coverage-action` and generated code coverage `lcov` files. For the React app, code coverage is based on Jest tests, and for the Django app, it is based on unittest tests. If code coverage decreases, the job fails, preventing the PR from merging.
* [OSDEV-740](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-740) - Setup module for mocking Redux store (`redux-mock-store"`)
* [OSDEV-733](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-733) - Setup React test library module (`@testing-library`)

### Release instructions:
* Update code
* Run migration up to 0134


## Release 1.7.3

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: January 12, 2024

### Bugfix
* [OSDEV-736](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-736) Removed logic to handle text only match response data as it already removed from matching functionality in Dedupe Hub. Previously it bring an error on response for user when potential match happened.

## Release 1.7.2

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: January 09, 2024

### Bugfix
* [OSDEV-721](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-721) Fixed issue with potential match logic when get facility data of match, previously it take facility id from Facility List Item, but it's wrong for Potential Match status as there is always NULL, facility id should be taken from Facility Match record in this case of Potential Match status.

## Release 1.7.1

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: December 21, 2023

### Bugfix
* Fixed issue with Facility Upload API error by covered a case when facility object didn't exist (create=false) & updated timeout value while waiting to produce kafka topic message [OSDEV-713](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-713)
* [OSDEV-714](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-714) - Users can now use the map on the search page simultaneously without missing any tiles. Before fixing this issue, if the map requested tiles that weren't cached, one user might not receive all the tiles. With the bug fixed, the tile generation logic can handle multiple requests at the same time, ensuring all users get the tiles they need for the map based on their search requests.

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-714](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-714) - `select_for_update` and `get_or_create` have been implemented in the `retrieve_cached_tile` function to ensure that if another thread attempts to `select_for_update()`, it will block at the `get_or_create()` until the first thread's transaction commits. The `get_tile` function, which serves as an API endpoint handler for tile generation, was implemented as an atomic transaction to facilitate the use of `select_for_update()` and maintain the lock until the end of the transaction. This approach helps to prevent crashes from parallel requests attempting to create a cache record with the same primary key, corresponding to the full URL path.
* [OSDEV-711](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-711) - Make JS code related to load testing for tile generation more universal so that they can work with the HAR file provided by the developer. For that, the `ZOOM_HAR_PATH` environment variable was introduced. More test cases for tile generation were added to test the environment close to production, focusing on densely saturated regions with facilities, such as China and India. The README.md file for the load tests was updated to reflect the changes made.

## Release 1.7.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: December 19, 2023

### Database changes
#### Migrations:
* 0130_introduce_separate_data_gathering_functions_for_the_index_table_columns - This migration:
    - rename `api_facilityindexnew` -> `api_facilityindex`
    - introduces separate data-gathering functions for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns and makes the `index_facilities` and `index_facilities_by` procedures use them.
    This migration is irreversible.
* 0131_introduce_sql_triggers_instead_of_django_signals - This migration introduces SQL triggers instead of Django signals. The migration is revertable.
* 0132_add_moderation_mode_field - This migration adds the field `is_moderation_mode` to table `api_user`.
* 0133_introduce_tile_caching - This migration creates the TileCache table and the DynamicSetting table. This migration is reversible.

#### Scheme changes
* [OSDEV-622](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-622) - Separate data-gathering functions were created for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns to collect data independently of the main procedure. The `index_facilities` and `index_facilities_by` procedures were updated to use new separate functions for collecting data for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns that require long SQL queries.
* [OSDEV-595](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-595) - Rename FacilityIndexNew to FacilityIndex
* [OSDEV-623](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-623), [OSDEV-624](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-624), [OSDEV-638](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-638) - New SQL triggers have been introduced to handle changes in the `api_contributor`, `api_extendedfield`, `api_facility`, `api_facilityclaim`, `api_facilitylistitem`, `api_facilitymatch`, `api_source`, and `api_facilitylist` tables at the database level. This change is essential for the future functionality of DedupeHub, which will communicate directly with the database. All the Django signals have been removed. Additionally, reindexing of the necessary columns of the index table has been transferred to these triggers, eliminating the need for the large SQL procedure previously used in conjunction with Django signals.
* [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637) - Add field `is_moderation_mode` to table `api_user`.
* [OSDEV-687](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-687) - The TileCache table was created to store cached tiles, and the DynamicSetting table was established to dynamically control app settings, specifically the expiration time of cached tiles.

### Code/API changes
* Update copy for "example" entries for List & Description fields & Contributor list page:
    - Update copy of Facility List example to: example: **Your Organization’s Name** Facility List June 2023
    - Update copy of Facility Description example to: example: This is the **Your Organization’s Name** list of suppliers for their retail products valid from Jan 2023 to June 2023
    - Update copy of rejected message to: "This list was rejected and will not be processed."
[OSDEV-640](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-640)
* In the Facility Claim Request form the field 'Preferred method of contact' has been done not mandatory. - [OSDEV-560](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-560)
* The new parameter `is_moderation_mode` has been added to GET and POST requests of the `/user-profile/{ID}/` API endpoint. - [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637)
* [OSDEV-687](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-687) - Implement cache logic for the get_tile view to either use a cached tile or generate a new tile for caching. When a user interacts with the map and makes a new request for a tile, the system checks if the requested tile, identified by its path, is already cached in the database. If the tile is already cached in the TileCache table, the cached tile binary data is retrieved and returned, avoiding the need to regenerate the tile for improved performance. Each cached tile has a default expiration period of 604,800 seconds (7 days). However, the admin can reconfigure this duration in the Django admin panel.
* Delete all Jenkins-related files since Jenkins is no longer in use.
* Move the maintenance page to the project repository, specifically to `src/maintenance`, to track the history of its changes.

### Architecture/Environment changes
* Remove FacilityDownloadSerializer and replace it with FacilityIndexDownloadSerializer
* Add a special Django management command, `install_db_exts`, that will install all the necessary PostgreSQL extensions for the database based on the required DB extensions for the 1.7.0 release.
* Create the `reset_database` Django management command that resets the database and repopulates it with fixture data, including facilities and matches. Update the `scripts/reset_database` shell script to include the call to this command, making it available for local development when it needs to be run inside the failed Django container for the first time. Also, rename shell scripts and affected management commands to enhance readability.

### Bugfix
* Increase amount of facilities downloaded to 100 per red and reduce time per request in 4-5 times
Fix issue with exceeding API requests. [OSDEV-557](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-442)

### What's new
* Updated copy for "example" entries for List & Description fields & Contributor list page
[OSDEV-640](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-640)
* The field 'Preferred method of contact' has been done not mandatory in the Facility Claim Request form. When the user fills this form he/she can skip this field. - [OSDEV-560](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-560)
* Data Moderator Profile. Implement the ability to activate the Merge function on the Facility Search page. - [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637)
* [OSDEV-302](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-302), [OSDEV-667](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-667) - Enable data moderators to trigger merges from the search results screen. Checkboxes were added to the search page right before each item in the search results to allow users to select facilities for merging. A "Merge" button was also implemented to open the Merge modal window, where all the data about the selected facilities is downloaded.
* [OSDEV-684](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-684) Removed Google Translate Plug-In in the system & UI Element
