## Release 1.12.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: May 18, 2024

### Database changes
#### Migrations:
* 0143_create_facility_claim_attachment_table.py - create api_facilityclaimattachments table to store claimant attachments per facility claim
* 0144_remove_unnecessary_columns_from_facility_claim.py - This migration replaces the old `index_approved_claim` function with a similar one that does not index the `preferred_contact_method` field. Additionally, the migration removes `email` and `preferred_contact_method` from the `FacilityClaim` model and the respective history table.

#### Scheme changes
* [OSDEV-931](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-931) - Since `email` and `preferred_contact_method` are no longer necessary for the claim form, they have been removed from the `FacilityClaim` model and the respective history table. Additionally, the old `index_approved_claim` function has been replaced with a similar one that does not index the `preferred_contact_method` field.

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-1021](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-1021) Update the release protocol. The release protocol has been updated with the recent changes. Has been added the section about reloading DedupeHub and QA notification.
* [OSDEV-997](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-997) - A new method, `message_claimant`, was added to the `FacilityClaimViewSet` for handling a POST request on the url-path `message-claimant` for messages to the claimant. 
Mail templates for the message to the claimant and the claims team signature were also added.

### Architecture/Environment changes
* [OSDEV-862](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-862) Fix `DB - Save Anonymized DB` / `DB - Apply Anonymized DB` workflows:
  - run actions on self-hosted runners to eliminate `lack of storage` issue that hapopen on github's runners.
  - use the `Test` environment for  `DB - Save Anonymized DB` action
* [OSDEV-989](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-989) - The Strategy pattern was utilized to consolidate the processing of new facilities received from both API requests and list uploads. The code responsible for executing this processing was refactored, and new classes were implemented:
    * ProcessingFacility - abstract class for facility processing
    * ProcessingFacilityList - class to process a facility list
    * ProcessingFacilityAPI - class to process a facility from an API request
    * ProcessingFacilityExecutor - class defines which interface to execute for the processing of a facility
* Resource allocation has been optimized for the Test environment. The number of ECS tasks in the Test environment has been reduced from 4 to 2, while maintaining system stability.
* [OSDEV-870](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-870) - In `docker-compose` for the `api-app`  added dependency that helps to fix connection with the database during tests pipelines for Dedupe-Hub:
* [OSDEV-1001](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-1001) - Deploy OpenSearch service to OS Hub infrastructure.
```
database:
    condition: service_healthy
```
* [OSDEV-1024](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-1024) - Dedupe Hub. Revise service configurations and refine gazetteer retraining. Remove option `--reload` & decrease number of workers in Dedupe Hub service configuration. Refactor initial rebuilding of gazetteer.
* [OSDEV-885](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-885) - Implement option to reset database for `Dev`, `Test` and `Pre-prod` environmet to `Deploy to AWS` pipleine
### Bugfix
* [OSDEV-870](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-870) - The returning confirm/reject URLs were fixed when a facility has been matched. Changes were made to the Dedupe-Hub to prevent adding rows with empty fields to the `api_facilitymatch` and `api_facilitymatchtemp` tables when the count of matches is more than one.
* [OSDEV-744](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-744) - API. When user want to confirm/reject potential_match it didn't found a match through `id`, was fixed by provided valid `id` from `api_facilitymatch` table.

### What's new
* [OSDEV-975](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-975) Reporting. Number of facilities with at least one extended field.`Facilities with Extended Field Data` report has been rewritten from Django ORM to SQL to optimize and speed up time of the report generation. Added two columns `With At Least 1 Extended Field` and `Sector`.

## Release 1.11.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: April 20, 2024

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-923](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-923) [Uptime] Added more logs around API/List uploads & Dedupe Hub match processing
* [OSDEV-606](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-606) Contributor Sort: Allow for ascending sort of contributors on the Map page. The sort_by parameter submits type of sorting order for facilities. Default sorting will be primary by public contributors count descending and secondary by name ascending/descending and contributors count ascending.

### Architecture/Environment changes
* [OSDEV-990](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-990) - Implement a ContriCleaner facade class to simplify interaction with client code. With this change, the client code only needs to instantiate the ContriCleaner class, pass the input data, and then call the `process_data` method without the need to define strategies or other details. This abstraction helps streamline the process and encapsulate complexity.
* [OSDEV-991](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-991) - Implement a chain of pre-validation and serialization handlers in the ContriCleaner to streamline data processing. Additionally, refactor the CompositeRowSerializer to set up leaf serializers using a specialized method, ensuring loose coupling between the CompositeRowSerializer and leaf serializers. Lastly, separate serialization and validation tasks from parsing in the ContriCleaner library for improved modularity and maintainability.
* [OSDEV-1000](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-1000) - A new class `ProcessingFacility` was created that will be responsible for managing the processing of new facilities from both API requests and list uploads. The functionality of processing a new facility received from an API request, which was previously in `facilities_view_set.py`, has been moved to `processing_facility.py`.
* [OSDEV-1007](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-1007) - The functionality of processing a new facility received from list uploads, which was previously in `facility_list_view_set.py`, has been moved to `create_facility.py`.
* [OSDEV-927](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-927) - Reduce resources allocated for bastions to t3.nano.
* [OSDEV-805](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-805) - Make Environment and project tag to be applied to all resources by defaul.
* [OSDEV-862](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-862) - Add `Save Anonymized DB` and `Apply Anonymized DB` actions that provde possibility to save anonymized dump to S3 bucket and then resotre Test or Pre-Prod environment from dump stored on S3.
* [OSDEV-859](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-859) - Creates task-definitation for scheduled task that
  * creates temporary postgresdb instance from latest production snaphsot in the `test` AWS account
  * run anonymization query
  * saves anonymized snapshot and removes the instance
* In response to recent stability observations, resource allocation has been optimized, reducing the number of ECS tasks in both production and pre-production environments from 16 to 12, maintaining system stability.

### Bugfix
* [OSDEV-996](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-996) The default sorting order for embedded maps was broken (changed to Descending by # Contributors). The default sorting order for embedded maps has been fixed (changed it back to Ascending by Name).
* [OSDEV-857](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-857) [Bug] Pre-prod isn't deleted by the 'terraform destroy' script. Command for destroying repositories on AWS pre-prod has been added.
* [OSDEV-888](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-888) - Facility Profile. An error occurs when trying to open a facility from the Status Reports page. The error occurred due to activity reports with the status `pending` containing fields with `null` values and these values pass to the `format_date` function as an argument. Modified the `get_activity_reports` method in the `FacilityIndexDetailsSerializer` to prevent passing a falsy `date` argument into the `format_date` function.
* [OSDEV-984](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-984) - Facility list upload. Header validation is failing, even though all the required columns and data are filled. Prepared basic implementation for ContriCleaner to validate headers (required fields) on early stage.
* [OSDEV-660](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-660) - Remove punctuation issues with duplicated commas and double quotes while facility list uploading.
* [OSDEV-986](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-986) - Fix the population of the custom data points uploaded via lists. Ensure that the full list header is saved in the database, and that the raw data for each facility list item is saved as a string of strings, with each value separated by a comma. This way, it helps maintain backward compatibility with the functionality responsible for displaying custom data points on the embedded maps. Also, revert to the previous default logic, which saves the sector as `Unspecified` when sector, sector_product_type, or product_type have empty values.
* [OSDEV-966](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-966) - Character limit validation has been implemented in the ContriCleaner library for name, address, and sector values. It enforces a maximum length of 200 characters for both the name and address values, and restricts sector values to 50 characters each. This fix addresses the issue where user uploads containing such invalid data caused requests to fail with unexpected errors.

### What's new
* [OSDEV-974](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-974) Reporting. Contributor type by %. Admin sees in the report data for the percent of data contributors on the platform by type (this should be in percent format with two decimal places shown), only accounts that have contributed data, the data should be ordered by most recent to oldest month and display mid-month values.
* [OSDEV-912](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-912) Facility Claim. Disable editing of name and address. The Facility name (English language) & Address fields of the claim details page have been removed and cannot be edited by the claimant.
* [OSDEV-571](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-571) Claimed Facility Details. Make the "Sector" field a dropdown instead of free text field. The `Sector` field became a dropdown that is pre-populated with the platform’s sector list from Django.
* [OSDEV-962](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-962) Update Release protocol. The Release protocol has been updated after the automatization of manual processes such as creating a release branch, restoring DB, deploy to AWS.
* [OSDEV-972](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-972) Reporting. Updating "Facility Uploads" report. Joined one table from two reports and added columns.New table with such columns:
`month`, `Total # of list uploads` in a given month (these are uploads that come from external contributors, NOT OS Hub team members), `# of public list uploads` in a given month (these are uploads that come from OS Hub team members AND have “[Public List]” in the contributor name), `Total facility listItems` uploaded in a given month, `# of Facilities` from Public Lists, `Total Facilities w/ status = new facility`, `# Public List Facilities w/ status = new facility`. Data is ordered from most recent to oldest
* [OSDEV-913](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-913) Claim. Updated the submitted claim auto-reply message for email template.
* [OSDEV-914](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-914) Claim. Updated the approved claim auto-reply message for email template

* Release date: December 21, 2023

### Bugfix
* Fixed issue with Facility Upload API error by covered a case when facility object didn't exist (create=false) & updated timeout value while waiting to produce kafka topic message [OSDEV-713](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-713)
* [OSDEV-714](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-714) - Users can now use the map on the search page simultaneously without missing any tiles. Before fixing this issue, if the map requested tiles that weren't cached, one user might not receive all the tiles. With the bug fixed, the tile generation logic can handle multiple requests at the same time, ensuring all users get the tiles they need for the map based on their search requests.

### Code/API changes
* [OSDEV-714](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-714) - `select_for_update` and `get_or_create` have been implemented in the `retrieve_cached_tile` function to ensure that if another thread attempts to `select_for_update()`, it will block at the `get_or_create()` until the first thread's transaction commits. The `get_tile` function, which serves as an API endpoint handler for tile generation, was implemented as an atomic transaction to facilitate the use of `select_for_update()` and maintain the lock until the end of the transaction. This approach helps to prevent crashes from parallel requests attempting to create a cache record with the same primary key, corresponding to the full URL path.
* [OSDEV-711](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-711) - Make JS code related to load testing for tile generation more universal so that they can work with the HAR file provided by the developer. For that, the `ZOOM_HAR_PATH` environment variable was introduced. More test cases for tile generation were added to test the environment close to production, focusing on densely saturated regions with facilities, such as China and India. The README.md file for the load tests was updated to reflect the changes made.

## Release 1.7.0

## Introduction
* Product name: Open Supply Hub
* Release date: December 19, 2023

### Database changes
#### Migrations:
* 0130_introduce_separate_data_gathering_functions_for_the_index_table_columns - This migration:
    - rename `api_facilityindexnew` -> `api_facilityindex`
    - introduces separate data-gathering functions for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns and makes the `index_facilities` and `index_facilities_by` procedures use them.
    This migration is irreversible.
* 0131_introduce_sql_triggers_instead_of_django_signals - This migration introduces SQL triggers instead of Django signals. The migration is revertable.
* 0132_add_moderation_mode_field - This migration adds the field `is_moderation_mode` to table `api_user`.
* 0133_introduce_tile_caching - This migration creates the TileCache table and the DynamicSetting table. This migration is reversible.

#### Scheme changes
* [OSDEV-622](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-622) - Separate data-gathering functions were created for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns to collect data independently of the main procedure. The `index_facilities` and `index_facilities_by` procedures were updated to use new separate functions for collecting data for the `api_facilityindexnew` table columns that require long SQL queries.
* [OSDEV-595](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-595) - Rename FacilityIndexNew to FacilityIndex
* [OSDEV-623](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-623), [OSDEV-624](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-624), [OSDEV-638](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-638) - New SQL triggers have been introduced to handle changes in the `api_contributor`, `api_extendedfield`, `api_facility`, `api_facilityclaim`, `api_facilitylistitem`, `api_facilitymatch`, `api_source`, and `api_facilitylist` tables at the database level. This change is essential for the future functionality of DedupeHub, which will communicate directly with the database. All the Django signals have been removed. Additionally, reindexing of the necessary columns of the index table has been transferred to these triggers, eliminating the need for the large SQL procedure previously used in conjunction with Django signals.
* [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637) - Add field `is_moderation_mode` to table `api_user`.
* [OSDEV-687](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-687) - The TileCache table was created to store cached tiles, and the DynamicSetting table was established to dynamically control app settings, specifically the expiration time of cached tiles.

### Code/API changes
* Update copy for "example" entries for List & Description fields & Contributor list page:
    - Update copy of Facility List example to: example: **Your Organization’s Name** Facility List June 2023
    - Update copy of Facility Description example to: example: This is the **Your Organization’s Name** list of suppliers for their retail products valid from Jan 2023 to June 2023
    - Update copy of rejected message to: "This list was rejected and will not be processed."
[OSDEV-640](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-640)
* In the Facility Claim Request form the field 'Preferred method of contact' has been done not mandatory. - [OSDEV-560](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-560)
* The new parameter `is_moderation_mode` has been added to GET and POST requests of the `/user-profile/{ID}/` API endpoint. - [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637)
* [OSDEV-687](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-687) - Implement cache logic for the get_tile view to either use a cached tile or generate a new tile for caching. When a user interacts with the map and makes a new request for a tile, the system checks if the requested tile, identified by its path, is already cached in the database. If the tile is already cached in the TileCache table, the cached tile binary data is retrieved and returned, avoiding the need to regenerate the tile for improved performance. Each cached tile has a default expiration period of 604,800 seconds (7 days). However, the admin can reconfigure this duration in the Django admin panel.
* Delete all Jenkins-related files since Jenkins is no longer in use.
* Move the maintenance page to the project repository, specifically to `src/maintenance`, to track the history of its changes.

### Architecture/Environment changes
* Remove FacilityDownloadSerializer and replace it with FacilityIndexDownloadSerializer
* Add a special Django management command, `install_db_exts`, that will install all the necessary PostgreSQL extensions for the database based on the required DB extensions for the 1.7.0 release.
* Create the `reset_database` Django management command that resets the database and repopulates it with fixture data, including facilities and matches. Update the `scripts/reset_database` shell script to include the call to this command, making it available for local development when it needs to be run inside the failed Django container for the first time. Also, rename shell scripts and affected management commands to enhance readability.

### Bugfix
* Increase amount of facilities downloaded to 100 per red and reduce time per request in 4-5 times
Fix issue with exceeding API requests. [OSDEV-557](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-442)

### What's new
* Updated copy for "example" entries for List & Description fields & Contributor list page
[OSDEV-640](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-640)
* The field 'Preferred method of contact' has been done not mandatory in the Facility Claim Request form. When the user fills this form he/she can skip this field. - [OSDEV-560](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-560)
* Data Moderator Profile. Implement the ability to activate the Merge function on the Facility Search page. - [OSDEV-637](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-637)
* [OSDEV-302](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-302), [OSDEV-667](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-667) - Enable data moderators to trigger merges from the search results screen. Checkboxes were added to the search page right before each item in the search results to allow users to select facilities for merging. A "Merge" button was also implemented to open the Merge modal window, where all the data about the selected facilities is downloaded.
* [OSDEV-684](https://opensupplyhub.atlassian.net/browse/OSDEV-684) Removed Google Translate Plug-In in the system & UI Element
